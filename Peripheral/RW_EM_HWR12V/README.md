# RW_EM_HWR12V

This is the RW_EM_HWR12V dual power supply. It is a simple and inefficient half wave rectifier with +12V and -12 outputs.
It may not be powerful enough to supply a whole rack, but it is very nice for module testing and development.
With heatsinks attached to both regulators the module can output close to 1A shared by both rails.
Only use 15V AC input with this module. 12V AC is not supported!
