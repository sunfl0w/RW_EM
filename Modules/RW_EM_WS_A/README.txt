This is the RW_EM_WS_A module. It is a module for converting sawtooth waves to triangle waves and triangle waves to sine waves. It is based on designs by Ray Wilson (musicfromouterspace.com) and Eddy Bergman (eddybergman.com).
The triangle stage consists of a inverter sawtooth output and a triangle output with a gain selecting potentiometer.
The sine stage incorporates a wave distortion potentiometer. At ~50% the module will output a sine wave.
A 50k trimmer was added to allow for fine tuning of the differential amplifier.
The triangle output is directly connected to the sine stage's triangle input if no path cable is inserted.
