This is the RW_EM_OUT_A module. A simple output module based on DIY Output v2 by EricaSynths (ericasynths.lv).
Capabilities include a left and right channel input (with no right channel input the left channel input is also used for the right channel) and separate headphone and line out sockets.
The left and right channel might be mixed up in my design. Sorry for that :D.
