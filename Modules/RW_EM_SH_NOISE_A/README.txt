This is the RW_EM_SH_NOISE_A module. A noise generator with sample and hold capabilities based on the mki x es SH NOISE design (ericasynths.lv).
Functionality includes white, pink and blue noise generation. The sample and hold portion of the module can sample white noise directly or an incoming voltage.
A sample clock signal needs to be supplied externally. The RW_EM_LFO_A works great for this purpose.
