This is the RW_EM_LFO_A module. A simple triangle and square output LFO based on design by synthnerd (synthnerd.wordpress.com).
Just a very simple LFO with a frequency from about 0.3Hz to 30Hz (only calculated, not tested so far). Output is from about -8V to +8V. This should be enough to trigger almost every module out there!
